## 🔍 About the Simulation
The **Apes-Collecting-Bananas-Simulation** uses interesting programming concepts including:

- **Multi-threading:** Separate threads simulate female, male, and baby apes competing for resources.
- **Processes:** Each family of apes operates as its own process, allowing for true parallel execution.
- **Inter-process Communication:** Data is shared among processes using shared memory, ensuring synchronized actions.
- **Semaphore Synchronization:** This feature prevents multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously, avoiding conflicts.
